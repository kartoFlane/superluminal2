https://github.com/kartoFlane/superluminal2


About

	Superluminal2 is a ship editor for the game FTL: Faster Than Light,
	and the expansion, FTL: Advanced Edition.
	The editor provides a layer of abstraction over the game's files, making
	the task of creating a functional ship much less daunting and easier.


Requirements

	Java (1.6 or higher)
		http://www.java.com/en/download/
	FTL: AE (1.5.10, Windows/OSX/Linux, Steam/GOG/Standalone)
		http://www.ftlgame.com/


Setup

	Extract the files from the archive anywhere.

	On the first run, you may be prompted to locate your FTL resources,
	specifically 'data.dat' in the 'resources' folder in FTL's 
	installation directory.
	On OSX, you can select 'FTL.app', since the resources are inside it.

	In most cases, this should be located automatically.
